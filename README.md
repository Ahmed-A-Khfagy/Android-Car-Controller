# Android-Car-Controller
This application was made for a competition where we were making a car using arduino as a micro controller, where 
we were building the car from scratch, it had many functionalities where it had things like voice controll, controll using accelerometer, 
and the normal controlls, and all the other buttons in the main menu were just for the extra functionalites like tracing a line, and avoiding obsticles, and so on, this was made right after I had started learning android and less than a year from when I had started learning programing and I had learning some learning conventions while working on it so the naming ways are a bit different from a place to another.
